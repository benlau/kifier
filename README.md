Kifier - The missing tool to turn your Web 2.0 application into Wiki.
==============================================================================

Google Doc/Drive , Evernote , and many other Web 2.0 provides online  document editing function. Contents can be linked across documents , sites by using hyperlink.  They works similar as wiki but with more advanced features and for your personal / organization data only.

However , making a referral of your current reading site in browser to those services is not straightforward. The common practise is:

1. Go to the address bar , copy the url to clipboard
2. Drag and drop the url to target Web 2.0 site, or launch the site then paste the content from clipboard
3. Rename the url with the title of the reading site. (It is the most troublesome step)

Kifier simplify the above process by taking out the step 3. Just press the Kifier button at the right of address bar. The URL with page's title will be copied  to clipboard directly. Then you may paste to the target site easily.

If you have dual monitor or installed the Dualless extension , you  may have both of the reading and target site shown on screen at the same time. In such case, you may drag the link in popup dialog to target site. It will be much simpler.
