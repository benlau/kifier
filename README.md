Kifier - The missing tool to turn your Web 2.0 application into Wiki.
==============================================================================

Kifier is a Chrome Extension for users to copy the URL of the current reading webpage in the browser. Then convert it into various formats includes Plain Text, HTML, Markdown, Google Spreadsheet etc.

Google Doc/Drive, Evernote, and many other Web 2.0 services provide online document editing function. Contents can be linked across documents/sites by using a hyperlink.  It works similar to the wiki but with more advanced features and for your personal/organization data only.

However, copy a link of your current reading site in a browser to those services is not straightforward. Because you can not copy siteâ€™s URL with the title by a single click.

With Kifier, you just have to press the Kifier button at the right of the address bar. The URL with the title will be copied to clipboard directly. Then you may paste to the target site easily.

If you have a dual monitor or installed the Dualless extension, you may have both of the reading and target site shown on screen at the same time. In such case, you may drag the link in popup dialog to target site. It will be much simpler.

The software is released under open source license, GPL 2.0.
